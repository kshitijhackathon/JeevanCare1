Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Medical Accuracy and Safety

Given our healthcare focus, we have additional responsibilities:

### Medical Information Standards
- All medical information must be sourced from authoritative medical literature
- AI-generated medical content must include appropriate disclaimers
- Contributors should not provide personal medical advice
- Medical accuracy takes precedence over feature development speed

### Patient Safety Priority
- Report any potential safety issues immediately
- Consider patient impact in all technical decisions
- Maintain highest standards for medical calculation accuracy
- Implement proper error handling for health-critical features

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at codefreaks0@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
