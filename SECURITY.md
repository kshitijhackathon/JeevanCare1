## Security Standards

Our healthcare platform implements industry-standard security measures to protect sensitive medical data:

### Data Protection
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All medical data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Adherence to healthcare data protection regulations
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Medical data is processed without persistent storage
- **Secure Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication with OAuth integration

### AI Model Security
- **Input Sanitization**: All medical inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Model Isolation**: AI models run in secure, isolated environments
- **Data Anonymization**: Personal identifiers are removed from AI processing
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all medical data interactions

### Infrastructure Security
- **Database Encryption**: PostgreSQL with encrypted connections
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and request validation
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic expiration
- **Network Security**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
