
I am building a **Healthcare web application** hosted on **Replit**, where patients can interact with an **AI Doctor** in real-time using **voice input**. The project aims to support conversations in **Hinglish (Hindi + English)**, allowing users to describe their health problems and get live responses and prescriptions.

The voice recognition feature is **crucial** for this AI doctor simulation. However, I am facing multiple problems in the implementation of **speech-to-text recognition**, especially on mobile devices and in Hindi.

Please help me debug and solve the following issues thoroughly.

---

## üîß Voice Recognition Setup I Am Using:

* **Web Speech API** (`window.SpeechRecognition` / `webkitSpeechRecognition`)
* JavaScript for triggering and handling recognition events
* Front-end built with HTML, CSS, JS
* Hosted on **Replit**

---

## ‚ùå Current Problems in Detail:

### 1. Voice Input Not Working Properly on Mobile Devices

* On Android Chrome and Safari iOS, voice input often doesn't start or ends immediately.
* No microphone permission prompt is shown sometimes.
* The recognition works fine on desktops, but fails silently on mobile.

**What I need**:

* Fix mobile compatibility issues.
* Ensure microphone permissions prompt appears on both Android and iOS.
* Possibly provide fallback mechanism or message to user when unsupported.

---

### 2. Frequent Speech Recognition Errors

* Getting errors like `network`, `no-speech`, `audio-capture`, etc.
* The app doesn‚Äôt handle these errors well ‚Äî the user just gets stuck.
* No retry or clear error messages shown.

**What I need**:

* Proper error handling for:

  * `no-speech`
  * `network`
  * `audio-capture`
  * `not-allowed`
* Display user-friendly messages like:

  * ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt hear you, please speak again.‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúInternet error. Please check your connection.‚Äù
* Automatic retry after small delay (optional toggle).

### 3. Hindi Voice Recognition Accuracy is Low

* Even when a user speaks clear Hindi, recognition shows wrong or broken words.
* Hinglish support is unreliable (words mix English-Hindi poorly).
* App does not allow choosing Hindi or Hinglish mode explicitly.

**What I need**:

* Optimize recognition to support `hi-IN` locale properly.
* Allow user to select language (English / Hindi / Hinglish).
* Adjust `recognition.lang = "hi-IN"` when Hindi is selected, `"en-IN"` for English, and `"hi-IN"` again for Hinglish.
* Add training phrases or bias grammar (if possible via SpeechRecognition API or external service).

---

### 4. No Real-Time Transcription Feedback

* Currently, the user has no visual confirmation that their speech is being captured.
* The recognized text shows only after the speech ends.
* This creates confusion and a poor experience.

**What I need**:

* Add real-time display of interim transcripts using `recognition.interimResults = true`
* Show the live transcript in a UI component (e.g., `div#liveTranscript`)
* Add animation or waveforms to show "listening" state
* Add visual indicators for:

  * Listening...
  * Processing...
  * Say something!

## üìã Sample Code Used:

Here‚Äôs a simplified version of what I‚Äôm using right now for speech recognition:

```js
const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
const recognition = new SpeechRecognition();

recognition.lang = "en-IN";
recognition.interimResults = false;
recognition.continuous = false;

recognition.onstart = () => {
  console.log("Voice recognition started. Try speaking into the microphone.");
};

recognition.onresult = (event) => {
  const transcript = event.results[0][0].transcript;
  document.getElementById("output").innerText = transcript;
};

recognition.onerror = (event) => {
  console.error("Speech recognition error", event.error);
};

function startRecognition() {
  recognition.start();
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Improvements You Should Help Me Implement

Please modify or rewrite my implementation to:

1. Detect and support mobile browsers correctly
2. Request microphone permission reliably
3. Improve UI/UX for speech recording (visuals + real-time feedback)
4. Add graceful error handling for different edge cases
5. Support both Hindi and English, especially **Hinglish**
6. Allow manual selection of language from dropdown (and switch `recognition.lang`)
7. Add timeout, cancel and reset buttons for better control
8. Optional: Suggest a more accurate third-party API (like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or Whisper ASR) that integrates well

---

## üß† Optional Enhancements

If possible, help me explore:

* Using **DeepSeek** or **Whisper** for accurate Hindi/Hinglish transcription.
* Output transcription result into a hidden `textarea`, which later passes into an **LLM** for live response.
* Add fallback to text input in case of repeated failure.

---

## üì≤ Final UI Behavior I Want:

* User clicks üéôÔ∏è button.
* UI shows **"Listening..."** state.
* While speaking, live transcription is shown.
* If silence or no speech, after 5 seconds show **"Didn‚Äôt catch that. Try again."**
* When done, full text is displayed and passed to AI Doctor.
* If Hindi/Hinglish selected, transcription and LLM reply should be in Hinglish tone.
* If error, auto-restart or let user retry with one click.
* Works consistently on desktop and mobile.

## üí¨ Voice-to-LLM Flow Summary:

1. Speech is converted to text (accurately in Hinglish).
2. Real-time transcript shown.
3. Transcription passed to AI Doctor (Claude or DeepSeek model).
4. LLM responds in Hinglish, in tone of doctor.
5. User gets spoken + text response.
6. If required, doctor recommends tests/medicines via voice & text.

## üì¶ Final Deliverables Requested:

* Optimized and debugged **JavaScript-based voice recognition** system
* Mobile-friendly, accurate, error-handled solution
* Multi-language (Hindi + English + Hinglish) support
* Real-time transcription feedback system
* Doctor-style response handover mechanism

**NOTE**: Please include all the necessary JS/CSS/HTML code changes required to implement the fixes. The entire system should be compatible with **Replit hosting environment**, and must not require Node.js backend unless you provide workaround or embed options.
